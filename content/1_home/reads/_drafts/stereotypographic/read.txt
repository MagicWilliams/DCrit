Blurb: In the most common usage today, stereotypes are understood as “widely held but fixed and oversimplified images or ideas of a particular type of person or thing.” Walter Lippmann popularized the term as a metaphor in his 1922 book Public Opinion. He saw stereotypes as pictures in our heads that simplify reality: “[Stereotypes] may not be a complete picture of the world, but they are a picture of a possible world to which we are adapted.”³ He recognized that stereotypes have the ability to create a recognizable or iconic figure and, through making multiple copies, to imprint this image on the mind of the public.
