Shortdescrip: As part of our How To:_____ series this spring, join author Justin Zhaung to discuss the development of the recent architecture text *Everyday Modernism: Architecture & Society in Singapore*. Through a lens of social and architectural histories, the book uncovers the many untold stories of the Southeast Asian city-stateâ€™s modernization, uncovering how modernism radically transformed Singapore and made its inhabitants into modern citizens. Part presentation and part conversation, Justin and design critic Vera Sacchetti will explore his process of researching, writing, and collating this collection of modern architecture in Singapore, bringing architectural design research from proposal to publication.

Through a lens of social and architectural histories, the book uncovers the many untold stories of the Southeast Asian city-state\u2019s modernization, from the rise of heroic skyscrapers, such as the Pearl Bank Apartments, to the spread of utilitarian typologies like the multi-storey car park. It investigates how modernism, through both form and function, radically transformed Singapore and made its inhabitants into modern citizens.<\/p><p>The book\u2019s 33 essays are richly illustrated with some 200 archival images and drawings as well as more than 90 contemporary photos by architectural photographer Darren Soh. It covers the beginnings of Singapore's modern landscape, but the book is also interested in endings; investigating how modern buildings have changed over time, and been adapted for new uses or even threatened with redevelopment today. By examining the evolution of the once exceptional into the typical and by learning how abstract spaces become lived places, the book traces how modernism has become part of everyday life in Singapore.<\/p>"},"id":"e9f6e228-15b1-4c9c-8d9c-4fc7cd5fb460","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
