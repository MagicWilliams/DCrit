(Recipients of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines become eligible for a booster six months after their second dose, and recipients of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine become eligible two months after their single dose.)<\/li><li>Those not yet eligible for a booster (or within two weeks of eligibility) will be able to enter provided they are two weeks past their second dose in a two-dose vaccine series or two weeks after receiving a single-dose vaccine. Children under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of a booster. <\/li><li>The only exception to the above will be for those who need reasonable accommodations due to a medical condition or sincerely held religious belief. Guests requesting an exemption must provide proof of the exemption, in addition to either a negative COVID PCR test taken within 72 hours of the event, or a negative COVID rapid antigen test taken within 6 hours of the event. At-home test results will not be accepted unless the test provides time-stamped, digital authentication of a negative result via an app, website, or email.<\/li><li>SVA students and staff should display the Clear4Work access badge upon entrance, along with their SVA ID. Non-SVA guests may present proof of vaccination (or a negative test, if applicable) on paper or a smartphone. Smartphone apps such as the NY State Excelsior Pass, NYC COVID Safe, CLEAR Health Pass, Docket (NJ), CT WiZ (CT), etc. are acceptable forms of proof and are preferred over physical (or photographs of) vaccination cards.<\/li><li>In addition to proof of vaccination, all guests 18 years or older must also present a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver\u2019s license or passport. The name on the ID must match the name on the proof of vaccination \/ negative test. Guests under 18 may use a school photo ID or must be accompanied by an adult who meets the above requirements.<\/li><\/ul>"},"id":"a7990041-ae45-45ba-99ba-9cda50e19970","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"level":"h3","text":"Masks"},"id":"64d6f043-8fc0-4b19-b800-00fe7f82357e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>Everyone entering SVA Theatre must wear approved face coverings that cover the nose and mouth at all times.
