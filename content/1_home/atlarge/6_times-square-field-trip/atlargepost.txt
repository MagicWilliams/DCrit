"We want to be a part of it, New York, New York!" 

Dâ€“Crit visited Times Square on Tuesday, to check out the views. We visited the new TSX Entertainment (and recently elevated Palace Theater), designed to create "city-stopping moments" on its 18,000 sq. ft. 8K interactive billboard. Check out the views some students shared from above the iconic red steps.
