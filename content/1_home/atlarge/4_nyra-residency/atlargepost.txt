NYRA is in residence!

We are pleased to announce a new publication residency with the New York Review of Architecture. In exchange for studio space in our department, NYRAâ€™s editor Samuel Medina, deputy editor Marianela D'Aprile, and publisher Nicolas Kemper will lead a series of lunchtime workshops with our students, all about turning their work into pitch-able and publishable pieces!
