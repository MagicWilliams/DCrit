Bio:

AJ Kushner is a writer, researcher, and spatial designer in Brooklyn with a particular fondness for historic interiors, architecture, and decorative arts. He has a BA in Art History with a minor in English Literature from Skidmore College and an MFA in Interior Design from Parsons School of Design. At Parsons, he developed a research and writing practice centered on queer history, material culture, and how natural and constructed environments are experienced and designed by LGBTQ+ individuals and collectives.

AJ is interested in queer interiority as a theoretical condition, with queerness itself as the root condition from which queer activation of space and time erupts. By experimenting with written, visual, and other forms of media, he hopes to create new forms of storytelling queer spatial and object narratives, and illuminate the work of the designers, users, participants, structures, and philosophies of our time, and the activations that result.
