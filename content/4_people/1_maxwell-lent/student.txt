Bio:

Maxwell Lent is a designer who loves to think about architecture. He graduated with a degree in Art History from Harvard College, where he wrote a thesis on the architectural replication found in a New York-based Hasidic group.

He has interned at world-renowned architecture firms Pei Cobb Freed, Woods Bagot, and, most recently, Rockwell Group. Following college, he worked for a Philadelphia-based developer specializing in adaptive reuse.

Most recently, he pursued a Masters of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania but left in pursuit of a better work-life balance. At D-Crit, he hopes to continue exploring how design influences his Jewish background and the community from which he hails. He also plans to embrace Americaâ€™s rail infrastructure by spending many hours commuting on Amtrak trains to and from Philadelphia.
