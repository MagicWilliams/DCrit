As a freelance creative, she has worked as a graphic designer and copywriter for Fennel Strategic Communications and Media, a Manila-based design agency for social causes. Currently, she is the Museum Education Officer of the Ateneo Art Gallery, where she has been managing the university museumâ€™s educational and public programs since 2018.
