Role: Independent researcher

----

Bio: Evelyn Meynard is an independent researcher who focuses on the revision of design histories and contemporary practices concerning under-represented or neglected critical and cultural perspectives. She is also interested in presenting her work–whether as curatorial projects or published criticism–in a form and manner accessible to the broadest possible public. Evelyn’s main interests in the field of material culture include but are not limited to architecture, urbanism, sustainability, and design theory. She is the author of a forthcoming book on Chilean architect Emilio Duhart (1917–2006). Currently, she is completing research and writing on two furniture collections Duhart designed in the early 1960s for two inns in the south of Chile, work that remained off the radar of scholars for decades. She holds a master’s in the History of Design and Curatorial Studies from Parsons School of Design.
