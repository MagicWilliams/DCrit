Bio:

Jessie is a big foodie and a lover of lox bagels .

She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Diplomacy, but over time has gradually become obsessed with art, design, and education. After a four-year stint as a co-founder of a top Chinese educational company, in 2017 Jessie set up her own studio, which focuses on empowering students to develop toolkits and design mindsets through her articles. Based on the deep research and analytical nature of her articles, Jessie’s studio has been evolving slowly but steadily in a way that is different from other companies. She always puts users’ needs at the heart of her work. She calls this feedback loop “sustainable development,” both for the students who are her clients, and for the studio itself.

Jessie believes long-term success depends on an intense focus on the Now, on seizing the moment. Her life philosophy is: “living in the present is living in the future.”
