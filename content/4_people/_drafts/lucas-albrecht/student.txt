Bio: Lucas Albrecht is a multidisciplinary designer, educator, and artist based in Brooklyn. He enjoys attempting and failing to make sense out of the world through the tools design provides. In a previous life he has worked on a multitude of projects like identities, books, configurators, conferences, exhibitions, and political campaigns. He most recently spent a year at Sylvain, which he left to pursue an MA in Design Research, Writing & Criticism at SVA. He is hoping to deepen his relationship to design as a malleable and actionable discipline in the hopes to expansively reorient his practice around impact. Weâ€™ll see.
