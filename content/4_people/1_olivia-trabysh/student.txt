Bio:

Olivia Trabysh mobilizes philanthropic dollars to fund social justice movements. Over the last decade, she has been a grantmaker and program and communications strategist for activist funds, community foundations, and most recently, the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation based in New York City. She researches public memorials across the United States and designs commemorative processes and monuments to bring justice to survivors of sexual violence.

Her grantmaking practices advance abolition and community-based approaches to safety through interconnected frames focused on race, class, gender, and climate. Her field leadership has interrupted the flow of resources to carceral systems and the growing power of fascist political associations undermining the right to protest in Southern and rural spaces. Olivia is a named contributor to #metoo. Internationalâ€™s Political & Social Framework and a Funders for Justice Fellow. She holds a BA in English from West Texas A&M University, with concentrations in art history and political science.
