Descrip: This course focuses on developing the writing portion of studentsâ€™ research projects through a series of workshops based on the essay. Students will experiment with voice, style and form as they hone their research and explore how to tie it to a narrative. This course features guest visits from notable writers focused on design and visual culture. Drawing on readings and other sources related to research projects, students work toward fostering a public discussion about design through clear, engaging and illuminating writing.
