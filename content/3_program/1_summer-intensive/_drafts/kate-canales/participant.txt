Bio:

Kate Canales is a Professor of Practice and Department Chair in the Department of Design at The University of Texas at Austin School of Design and Creative Technologies. In this role she is responsible for overseeing strategy, operations, governance, curriculum and experience design for all four Design degrees (BA, BFA, MA and MFA) as well as the Center for Integrated Design which offers Design coursework to hundreds of non-design majors each year. Under Kate’s leadership, the department has focused on expanding student access to design education and opening up the department’s definition of design work through new partnerships, hiring, expanded curriculum, and updated admissions practices. 

In her work as an educator and administrator Kate draws from her early career as a professional product designer and creative director – first at IDEO and later at frog. Now, Kate’s creative practice and curiosity center around instances where design and human behavior influence one another. What does design compel (or allow) us to do? And how can observation of existing behavior inform better design? She teaches classes in design ethnography, generative prototyping, and project studios.
