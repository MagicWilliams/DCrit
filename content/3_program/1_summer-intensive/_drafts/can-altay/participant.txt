Bio:

Can Altay is an artist with a background in design. After his studies on interior architecture and environmental design, he ventured into further studying and making art. He also did a PhD along the way and became a Professor. At Istanbul Bilgi University, he established and headed an undergraduate program on Product Design for 7 years, and also headed the Interior Design program for a shorter period. 

During the pandemic, Can incorporated a series of conversations into his teaching work, encouraged by the time at hand, and distance learning tools. These conversations were so fruitful in terms of engagement and interest that he decided to embark on a podcast series. 

The podcast “Ahali Conversations” includes conversations with cultural producers, looking at spaces and practices that allow new communities to emerge. He speaks with artists, designers, curators, architects, and more to unfold their take on making work and inhabiting institutions. The podcast received a grant from the Graham Foundation for its third season.
