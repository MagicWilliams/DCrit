Sophia C. An is a Design & Trends Writer at Futures Design, Amazon in San Francisco/Seattle. Believes art and written words serve as a way to share our unique cultural heritage to come to life and help convey some of our most elusive thoughts and emotions. Deeply curious about our creativity process of seeing and exploring our place in the world through the lens of art and literature.

Fascinated by diverse methods of foresight strategy, she often finds herself reading and observing the past to better understand our present and the possible futures.
