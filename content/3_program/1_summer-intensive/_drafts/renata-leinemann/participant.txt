Bio:

Renata Leinemann is project manager at an Architecture and Design Studio in São Paulo. Graduated in Architecture and Urban Design by Mackenzie University in Brazil, her project “The countryside as identity: a phenomenological approach” was nominated for Best Thesis Award by the Architecture and Urbanism Council (CAU) for the architectural design, graphical and narrative work. Since 2016, she has gathered international experience in different scales of architecture, and believes that a multidisciplinary approach empowers the creative process. 

Her work attempts to explore the elements that create a space with character, with the ability to allow emotions, connecting the place with its user. She aims to design spaces that recognize the dialogue between the individual scale of a building and its collective impact, creating a sense of belonging.
