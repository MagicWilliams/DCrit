Bio: Tejal Gala lives in Geneva. She has a BA in retail design and a MA in space and communication design. Her independent practice focuses on retail design, communication design and experimental spatial design. She finds the role of art and design in the socio-political context of urban environments powerful and interesting to investigate. She aspires to explore ingenious expressions of contemporary art in public spaces that require stretching the tools of thought and expression. Her background from Mumbai drives her to question the striking contrast to the urban landscape in West-European societies and those in the South Asian region, highlighting the socio-cultural sensitivity to the experience of art. She is convinced that written knowledge creation is an integral part of design practice through intellectual exchange, cultural debate, and social change. Keen to strengthen research methods and sharpen analytical skills through the set of workshops, she looks forward to moving beyond the comfort of descriptive written style and attempting unorthodox expressions in writing through this course.
