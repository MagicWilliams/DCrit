Bio: Kelly Konrad holds an MA in the History of Design and Curatorial Studies from Parsons Paris. She has served as intern to the Director of the Musée Carnavalet and in the curatorial department of Sculpture and Decorative Arts at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Her primary research interests include the domestic furniture, interiors, gardens, and architectural ornaments of France and the Southern United States. She pursues histories, both individual and collective, of place-making—of what it is to make a home and what it is to feel at home in the world. In 2019, she completed a research fellowship at the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Since 2018, she has taught in the department of Art and Design History and Theory at Parsons School of Design and in 2021, she was named Art Buyer for McNally Jackson Independent Booksellers in New York City.
