Descrip:

For your project you want to look for something in this moment that intrigues you, that you see and are curious about, that maybe you can’t quite let go of. It might be a statue you see on the one walk you do each day. Or, if you can’t go outside, the singular tree out your window and your need to understand that species. It could be a scrap of language, or a piece of infrastructure, the company’s name emblazoned on the elevator you take to your apartment. Or, just something you’ve spotted in this time, in your place. This project is about seeing anew and then digging deep, about bringing the wonder one might to nature, to the woods, to wherever you are.

You will be working in a group of three to research one object. You will all share your research in your group, but you will work individually on your outline. The idea is to see how you pull together the research.
