    “I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the range of writing formats taught by first-class practitioners was extremely effective and energizing. Collectively, their well-distilled tips are invaluable takeaways. It's all about words and how to use them in the most compelling and meaningful way. The program’s fast-paced tempo felt like speed dating, but each date was a great ‘catch’ who imparted a healthy dose of wisdom.”
    – Cara McCarty, Summer Intensive Class of 2021

    criticism, and tools to take away, but
    the best thing about the intensive was
