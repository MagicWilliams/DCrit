Descrip:

This two-part workshop helps students see pitches from the POV of the editor, who in turn is dedicated to seeing things from the POV of the reader. A successful pitch needs to persuade an editor that the proposed piece will be relevant and of interest to the publication’s audience. Relevance means answering the question “So what?” The most compelling design story pitches have a timely news “hook” or are connected to urgent social, cultural, or political issues. To better understand this connection, we’ll approach design stories from the inverse direction, looking for a design story within a current news story. In the second session, we’ll turn those stories into pitches, to be reviewed by guest editors.
