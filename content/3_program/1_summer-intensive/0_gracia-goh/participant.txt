Bio:

Gracia is a designer working at the intersection of urbanism, design, and justice. Her practice involves understanding the complexities of urban political ecologies and designing toward a more equitable future. Her interest in cities was shaped by her childhood experiences of growing up in Singapore, a small, rapidly developing Asian nation-state.

She is currently pursuing an MS in Design and Urban Ecologies at The New School. She also collaborates with local organizations such as the NYC Community Land Initiative in advocating and promoting the Community Land Act. Previously, Gracia worked as a designer and researcher at Chemistry, a strategic design consultancy, where she facilitated human-centered design workshops and research activities for business transformation. She graduated as valedictorian from LASALLE College of the Arts with a BA in Design Communication.
