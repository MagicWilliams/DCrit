Descrip: For this workshop, you’ll be looking for examples of the ways in which habitats built for human beings (cities, suburbs, parks, highways, etc.) have been claimed by other creatures: insects, mammals, birds, reptiles, microbes… We won’t be looking at the skills that enabled humans to transform the natural world to suit their needs, but the way that other animals have borrowed those transformations. How have the places and things we’ve fashioned to satisfy our requirements been co-opted by other life forms? If animals, wild and domesticated, are at home in an urban environment, what are the boundaries between the natural and artificial worlds?  Do such boundaries truly exist?
