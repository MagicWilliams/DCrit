Bio:

Clara Cayosa is a graphic designer currently based in San Francisco as a cohort for Letterform Archiveâ€™s TypeWest program and is expected to graduate in December 2023. She specializes in brand identities, custom typefaces and printed matter.

There is currently a lack of literature on the history and practice of graphic design in the Philippines. Through Tipong Pilipino, an incubator for Filipino type she founded in 2020, Clara intends to research, archive and write about Filipino graphic design while developing and supporting typefaces with local sensibilities.
