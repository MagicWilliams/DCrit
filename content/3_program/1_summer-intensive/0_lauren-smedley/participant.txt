Bio:

Lauren is a multidisciplinary designer and design educator. She currently teaches within the Integrated Design and Creative Writing programs at the University of Baltimore.

She received her BFA in Graphic Design at the University of the Arts and her MFA in Design from the University of Texas at Austin. Her MFA thesis, *Six Principles for Redesigning Museum Interpretation*, sought to discover interactive ways museums can provide content to visitors beyond the traditional label and content panel.
