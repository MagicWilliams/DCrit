Descrip:

The Speaking of the Streets Project is a two week assignment that will culminate in the production of a piece of theater built from scenes and scraps written by students. You’ll be asked to produce both a monologue and a duologue. 

Our study of dialogue will serve as a training exercise to sharpen skills of observation and will eventually help us build this work of collaborative art. The project will allow us to present, in a kaleidoscopic view, an array of voices commenting on our current crisis from different parts of the country and the world.

We’re living through a period of upheaval and transition. We’ll examine how current events leave their mark on our conversations, our interactions, and our language.
