Bio: Laura is a freelance digital designer and software developer whose clients include fashion brands, furniture companies, technology startups and arts organizations. She previously worked as an in-house software developer at Artsy, an online art marketplace and platform offering various digital services to art galleries and institutions. She is interested in the social and political contexts surrounding design, visual culture, and digital media. She holds a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design, where she first became interested in digital technology and media as creative tools, and a MA in Philosophy from King’s College London, where she wrote her thesis on the distinction between works of “art” and “craft”, specifically works situated in a fine art context that blur this distinction through their employment of handicraft or tradecraft techniques and materials.
