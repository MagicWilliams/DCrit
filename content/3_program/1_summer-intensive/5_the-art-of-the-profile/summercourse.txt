Descrip:

A successful profile is an artful interpretation of a subject’s life. It can reveal the processes, inspirations, and biographical background of your interviewee—be it a graphic designer, a painter, or an architect. An effective profile makes implicit motivations explicit. It tells the story of someone’s life with accuracy and nuance.

Past profile subjects have included: Leo Porto, Felipe Rocha, Natasha Jen, Eddie Opara, Julio Torres, Adam Rigg, Alisa Grifo, Marco ter Haar Romeny, Mike Eckhaus, Sarah Zapata, Ti Chang, John Wilson, Craig L. Wilkins, and Mimi Zeiger.
