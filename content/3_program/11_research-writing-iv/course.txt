Descrip: In the publishing world, a team of editors and proofreaders is responsible for developing, refining and checking an author’s prose before publication. The copyeditor sets the style standard and enforces it, knows and applies grammar and punctuation rules, and formats text elements such as citations, all while being sensitive to the author’s voice and the expectations of the audience. To develop their own inner copyeditor, students will learn to hone their self-editing tools, including recognizing common mistakes and challenges in editing their own work. This course also features guests in other editorial roles, including acquisition editors and assignment editors who become part of the students professional network beyond the program.
