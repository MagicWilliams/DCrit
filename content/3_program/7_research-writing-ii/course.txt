Descrip: In this course students explore the building blocks of researching and writing feature-length nonfiction narratives. The course begins with a warm-up workshop focused on objective versus subjective approaches to writing about design. The next segment of the course focuses on interviewing skills, while the final segment asks students to develop narratives from material found in selected archives. Students will learn interviewing skills and best practices, conducting several interviews to produce a written profile piece. A selection of New Yorkâ€™s most significant and esoteric public and private archives, collections and libraries will be visited, and students will practice constructing compelling visual and written narratives based on individual discoveries and research.
