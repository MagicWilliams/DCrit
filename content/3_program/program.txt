About: [{"content":{"text":"<p>The program combines humanities-oriented critical thinking and journalistic tools to produce writing and editorial content intended to inform and engage broad audiences. The rigorous one-year MA with thesis offers a high-impact, targeted program well suited to the circumstances of both established professionals and recent graduates wishing to continue their studies at an advanced level. <\/p><p>Here in the SVA Department of Design Research, Writing &amp; Criticism we study design in all its manifestations, with a pronounced interest in its contexts and consequences. This means we don\u2019t just focus on designed products or buildings, but also on the infrastructure that connects them, and the policy that shapes them. We try to look at what happens after a designed product is launched. We go beyond the glossy images supplied by the manufacturer to discover how things actually get used and discarded, and how they impinge upon our daily reality.<\/p>"},"id":"58910f97-604f-4b8c-ab9b-733bf8d94db8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]

    Design Research Makes it Happen: Kurt Andersen, Paola Antonelli + More
    
    The program formerly known as D-Crit is now a one-year MA in Design Research. To celebrate the occasion, we made a series of videos that shows how far research can take you and how sexy it can make you. Watch the first episode where faculty, students, and alums of the department recount their love affairs with Design Research (as well as performing holograms, flying green tree snakes and 51-hour journeys to South Sudan) while they share with us how they teach it, study it, and practice it in their daily work.

Cdescrip:

Through workshops, seminars, lectures, and site visits, students examine the issues and policies that shape the designed environment; learn research methods, reporting techniques, and theoretical models; and experiment with a range of media vehicles for communicating their research, including writing, podcasting, and public speaking.

Each student will identify an individual research territory to explore during the year, culminating in a thesis portfolio of written and applied media projects. Degree candidates must successfully complete 30 credits, including all required courses, with a cumulative grade point average of 3.0. A residency of two academic semesters is required.
